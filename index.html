											<h2>Why do players make in-game purchases? A Dual Perspective of Goal-Setting and Flow Experience </h2>
											<p> ABSTRACT</p>
										</header>
										<p> Deciphering how mobile game players are motivated to purchase in-game virtual items is vital for developers to design and monetize their games. In this study, we drew on a dual perspective of goal-setting theory and flow theory to disentangle the relationships among goal-setting (i.e., goal specificity and goal difficulty), flow experience (i.e., perceived enjoyment and attention focus), and in-game purchase intention. Through an online survey of 445 mobile game players, the results show that both goal specificity and goal difficulty are positively associated with the two dimensions of flow experience, which, in turn, positively predict the intention to purchase in-game items. The post hoc analyses further reveal the mediating roles of perceived enjoyment and attention focus as well as the differential impacts of goal-setting on them. Additionally, the distortion of goal proximity is discovered to reinforce the effects of perceived enjoyment and attention focus on in-game purchase intention. A longitudinal cohort analysis confirmed the robustness of the findings. This study sheds light on in-game purchases by addressing an elusive knowledge gap of the limited understanding of the roles goal-setting and flow experience play within the context of mobile games. It also proffers insights to mobile game developers and marketers on how to boost in-game sales by sensitizing them to the setting of in-game goals and optimization of gaming experience.</p>
